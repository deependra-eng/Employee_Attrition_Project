# Employee_Attrition_Project

Project Overview: The Employee Attrition project aims to analyze factors contributing to employee turnover and develop strategies to reduce attrition rates.

Data Sources: Data was collected from the Kaggle. 

Data Preparation: Data was cleaned to remove duplicates and missing values.

Data Modeling: A predictive model was built using logistic regression to identify key factors influencing attrition, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and salary.

Results and Impact: The project identified low job satisfaction and lack of career growth opportunities as key drivers of attrition. As a result, the company implemented employee engagement programs and career development initiatives, leading to a reduction in attrition rates.
